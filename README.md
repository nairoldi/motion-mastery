This is a workout tracker web-app by Nico Airoldi. The tech stack is MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, Node).

# Node

    The app is using an express to run the server and connect to a mongoose database to store all data.

# Vite-React

    The front end is built with vite-react that provides fast and simple enviorment for web based applications. I am using tailwindcss to build and design the components. The compents are linked using react router dom.

# Tests

    I am using jest for testing. To run tests open terminal and make sure you are in the node folder and run "npm test".

# Latest to do / commit note:

displays the lastest favorited and previous workout. The boxes for them can be clicked, i need to now set up the previous and favorite workout pages. go to goals and setting buttons added as well, those pages also need to be made. I also need to update the backend for the login streak, weight change , and favorite workout.
